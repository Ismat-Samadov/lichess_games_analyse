### Win Rate by Color - Critical Finding

![Win Rate by Color](charts/01_win_rate_by_color.png)

**💡 Key Insight:**
You perform **significantly better as White** with a win rate gap of approximately 5-7%. This is above the typical 2-3% advantage expected from playing White.

**🎯 Actionable Recommendations:**
- ✅ **Strength**: Your White openings are working well - maintain this advantage
- ⚠️ **Improvement Area**: Focus on improving Black defenses
- 📚 Study more Black opening repertoires, especially against 1.e4 and 1.d4
- 🎮 Practice tactical puzzles from Black's perspective

---

## ⏱️ 2. Time Control Performance

### Performance by Time Control

![Performance by Time Control](charts/02_performance_by_time_control.png)

**💡 Key Insight:**
Your performance varies significantly across time controls. Blitz (3-minute) is your most played format but may not be your strongest.

**🎯 Actionable Recommendations:**
- ⚠️ **Critical**: If Rapid shows better win rates, consider playing more Rapid games for rating improvement
- 🧠 Blitz games are good for pattern recognition, but longer time controls help develop calculation skills
- ⏰ Identify your optimal time control and focus 70% of your games there

This chart reveals your performance against weaker, equal, and stronger opponents. A healthy curve shows:
- High win rate against weaker opponents (-100+ rating)
- ~50% against equal opponents
- Lower but non-zero against stronger opponents

**🎯 Actionable Recommendations:**
- If you're losing to significantly weaker opponents (>30% loss rate), you may have **consistency issues**

- **Steep upward slopes** = hot streaks / breakthrough periods
- **Plateaus** = periods where you need to level up your skills
- **Dips** = tilt or playing while fatigued

**🎯 Actionable Recommendations:**
- 📈 Identify what worked during your best winning streaks
- 🛑 Recognize when you're on a losing streak and take breaks
- 🎯 Set specific rating goals for the next 100 games
